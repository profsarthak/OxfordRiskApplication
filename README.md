# OxfordRiskApplication
For the Behavioral/Data Science internship.

In this markdown file, I will talk about myself and why I am interested in this role. I'm excited about this opportunity because it sits at the intersection of behavioural science, data and real-world decision-making, a space I've grown deeply committed to. What drew me to this role wasn't just the technical challenge, but the chance to apply analytical rigor to uncover why people act the way they do, and use those insights to shape better products. The fact that Oxford Risk is building tools to help people make better financial choices throughout life is a mission I strongly align with.

Over the past few years, I've built a strong foundation in both data analysis and behavioural science. In my academic work, amongst other papers, I ran an empirical study on undergraduate students who had also been active investors to better understand the relationship between behavioral biases in investing and portfolio performance. In my other work, I've focused on uncovering how expressed traits do - or don't - match real-world behaviour, and how those mismatches can be productively understood. 

I enjoy working where data alone isn't enough, but where behavioural insight can make it meaningful. This task, in particular, affirmed what I enjoy most: translating fragmented signals into compelling narratives - and doing so with curiosity, care and an appreciation for complexity. I'm looking to grow in a team that values that kind of thinking. I believe Oxford Risk to be that kind of environment.

You'll find the main analysis script (both .py and .ipynb) for the data task and exploratory data analysis (EDA), and a PDF file with my insights and takewaways from EDA in this repository. If nothing else, thank you for this opportunity.

Cheers!
